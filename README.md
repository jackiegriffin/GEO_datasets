# GEO_AKR1C3

Pre-clinical data: AKR1C3 top hit upregulated in ER+ bone metastases.
Objective: Mine literature to validate this phenotype in clinical ER+ breast cancer metastatic tumors

SRA = Sequence Read Archives

Need to access data in SRA using SRAdb Package

The default storage location is in the current working directory and the default filename
is “SRAmetadb.sqlite”; it is best to leave the name unchanged unless there is a pressing
reason to change it. Since this SQLite file is of key importance in SRAdb, it is perhaps of
some interest to know some details about the file itself.
